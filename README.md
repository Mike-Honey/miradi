Files to support analysis projects on the Miradi system www.miradi.org

/ResultsChainDiagrams sub-folder naming standard is /[Project Name]. Special characters in Project Names have to be removed to meet github & file system constraints. 

Within each sub-folder, Results Chain diagrams should be named [Results Chain ID and Name].png. Those files can then be referred to by analysis tools e.g. Power BI.
